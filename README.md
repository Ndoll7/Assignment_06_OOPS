ðŸ§  OOP Practice Assignments in Python
Assignment List
Using self:
Create a Book class. Initialize with title and author using self. Add a summary() method to print both.

Using cls:
Build a User class to count the number of users created. Use a class variable and a class method to access the count.

Public Variables/Methods:
Define a Laptop class with a public model attribute and a boot() method. Demonstrate accessing both from outside the class.

Class Variables/Methods:
Create a School class with a class variable for school_code. Add a class method to update the code for all instances.

Static Methods:
Implement a StringUtils class with a static method reverse(s) that returns the reversed string.

Constructors/Destructors:
Design a Session class that prints a message when a session starts (object created) and ends (object deleted).

Access Modifiers:
Make a Customer class with a public name, protected _email, and private __credit_card. Test access levels.

super():
Develop a Vehicle class with make. Inherit Bike from Vehicle, add type, and use super() in the constructor.

Abstract Classes:
Use abc to define an abstract Appliance class with abstract method power_usage(). Inherit Fan and implement it.

Instance Methods:
Write a Cat class with name and color. Add a meow() instance method that prints a message with the catâ€™s name.

Class Methods:
Create a Ticket class with a class variable tickets_sold. Add a class method to increment this count.

Static Methods:
Build a Geometry class with a static method area_of_circle(radius) returning the area.

Composition:
Define a Battery class and a Phone class. Pass a Battery instance to Phone and access a method of Battery via Phone.

Aggregation:
Make a Team class and a Player class. Store independent Player objects in Team to show aggregation.

MRO & Diamond Inheritance:
Create classes X, Y, Z, W where W inherits from both Y and Z, and both inherit from X. Override a method in Y and Z, and test MRO in W.

Function Decorators:
Write a timer decorator that prints execution time of a function. Apply it to a compute() function.

Class Decorators:
Create a timestamp_class decorator to add a created_at attribute to any class it decorates.

Property Decorators:
Implement a Rectangle class with private _width and _height. Use @property, @setter, and @deleter for area.

callable() & call():
Build a Divider class that takes a divisor and implements __call__() to divide input numbers.

Custom Exception:
Define a NegativeBalanceError and raise it in a withdraw(amount) method if balance goes negative. Handle with try-except.

Custom Iterable:
Create a Fibonacci class that generates Fibonacci numbers up to a limit using __iter__() and __next__().

Polymorphism:
Create a base class Shape with a method draw(). Inherit Circle and Square from Shape and override draw() in each. Demonstrate polymorphic behavior by calling draw() on a list of shapes.

Association:
Make a Doctor class and a Hospital class. Show association by assigning doctors to hospitals, but allow doctors to work at multiple hospitals.

Binary Search Tree:
Create a BinarySearchTree class with methods to insert and search for elements.

Calculator:
Implement a Calculator class with methods for add, subtract, multiply, and divide operations.
